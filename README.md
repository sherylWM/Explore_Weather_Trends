# Explore_Weather_Trends
This is the first Project of the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. 

Goal: To analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends to where I live with overall global temperature trends.

Details:
My city is Indianapolis in Indiana, United States. 
Datasets: 
There are 2 csv files namely globaldata.csv and citytemp.csv that contain temperatures across the globe and temperatures in Indianapolis respectively. 
Global temperatures are recorded from 1750 to 2015. There are 266 rows in the globaldata.csv dataset. 
citytemp.csv dataset has values recorded from 1743 to 2013.
Summary_report.pdf explains the project and observations made from the data visualizations. I have used the concept of 5-year, 7-year and 10-year moving average concept to compare the temperatures in Indianapolis with global temperatures.  

Initial data cleaning and analysis has been done using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
